## DEVELOPMENT

### If You want to help finding Bugs or solving Bootloops...
- Follow the Instructions for installing MARS
- You have extracted Folders like META-INF but which also contains a System Folder
- Inside this System Folder, copy all Contents to another Location outside of the "Zip" You want to create
- Start adding back Folders like "App", "Vendor", "System_Ext" one by one
- See what causes the Problems and try again with less Folders
- Tell Miustone what's causing Issues or Bootloops and we can solve it!
